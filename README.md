Changelog

Version 1.0.2.3 - fixed the loot drop tweak and improves the file entry; instead of having to input path+acodyssey.exe you just need to input path if it fails to auto find the game.
Version 1.0.2.4 - fixed steam executable finding logic...well not fixed, I implemented it as original method did not search steam directories.
