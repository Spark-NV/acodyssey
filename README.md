# Game Tweak Pack - Modular Version

A generic tweak utility for games, originally made by Vahndaar for Assassin's Creed Odyssey, It started as a simpel python script then i decided to add a gui then decided to make it support as many games as i want.
So now it supports multiple games through json files.


## Features

### Configuration-Driven
- **tweaks.json**: All tweak definitions are stored in a JSON file
- **Easy to Add Tweaks**: Simply add new entries to existing JSON files or create new ones.
- **No Code Changes**: Adding new tweaks doesn't require modifying Python code

### GUI
- **Collapsible Sections**: Organized tweak categories

## Usage

Either run the python script or use the compiled exe.

to run the python script, type this into cmd:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Adding New Tweaks

To add a new game, you can manually create a new tweak configuration file in `config/game_tweaks/` following the format of the existing files. Each game configuration includes a `default` flag - set this to `true` for the game you want to be selected by default when the application starts.
or you can you the gui and use the add/edit button, doing this will create the json for you.


## Notice

This definitly has become a universal program for me to start adding all my games that i have multiple different mods/tweaks for. it is probably buggy and should just been made in c but o well.
